    <h1>Internet Security: A Guide for Consumers</h1>
    <p>The internet has become a vital part of daily life. We shop, work, learn, and connect with others online. But with all its benefits, the internet also comes with risks that can compromise your security and privacy. Understanding these risks and knowing how to protect yourself is key to staying safe in today’s digital world.</p>

    <h2 id="summary">Quick Summary</h2>

    <h2>Understanding the Risks</h2>
    <p>Online threats can feel abstract, but they often start with ordinary activities like checking email, using social media, or connecting to public Wi-Fi. Knowing what to watch out for can help you avoid becoming a target.</p>

    <h3>Common Threats</h3>

    <h4>Phishing Attacks</h4>
    <p>Imagine getting an email that looks like it’s from your bank, urging you to click a link to "verify your account." These emails are often fake, created to trick you into sharing sensitive information like passwords or credit card numbers. Phishing attacks rely on creating a sense of urgency and deception, and they’re one of the most common online scams.</p>

    <h4>Malware</h4>
    <p>Malware, short for "malicious software," includes viruses, ransomware, and spyware. These programs can infect your device through suspicious downloads or email attachments. For example, you might download what looks like a free app, only to find it secretly collects your personal data or locks your files until you pay a ransom.</p>

    <h4>Data Breaches</h4>
    <p>When hackers break into company databases, they often steal personal information like email addresses, passwords, and even financial details. These breaches can lead to identity theft or fraud, affecting millions of people at once. If you’ve ever received an email saying your account was "part of a data breach," this is what happened.</p>

    <h4>Wi-Fi Security Risks</h4>
    <p>Using public Wi-Fi at a coffee shop might seem convenient, but these networks are often unsecured. Hackers can easily intercept your data or set up fake Wi-Fi hotspots to trick you into connecting. This means your private information, like login credentials or payment details, could be exposed.</p>

    <h2>Sophisticated Attacks</h2>

    <h3>Zero-Day Attacks</h3>
    <p>A zero-day attack takes advantage of a vulnerability in software that hasn’t been discovered by its creators yet. For example, a hacker might exploit a flaw in your operating system before the company can release a fix. These attacks are especially dangerous because they’re hard to predict or block.</p>

    <h3>Multi-Methodology Threats</h3>
    <p>Many attacks combine different techniques. For instance, a hacker might send a phishing email that includes a link to a malware-infected website. Or they might use public Wi-Fi to launch a man-in-the-middle attack, where they intercept your communication with a legitimate website. These layered methods make the attack harder to recognize and defend against.</p>

    <h3>Spotting Scams</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Unusual Requests:</strong> Emails or messages asking for personal information or money are often scams.</li>
        <li><strong>Generic Greetings:</strong> If a message doesn’t address you by name, it could be fake.</li>
        <li><strong>Small Errors:</strong> Watch for typos or slightly altered URLs (e.g., "yourbnk.com" instead of "yourbank.com").</li>
        <li><strong>Account Changes:</strong> If you’re logged out of an account or notice unfamiliar activity, investigate immediately.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How to Protect Yourself</h2>

    <h3>General Tips</h3>

    <h4>1. Use Strong, Unique Passwords</h4>
    <p>Avoid using simple passwords like "password123" or reusing the same password across multiple accounts. Instead, create passwords with a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Consider using a password manager to keep track of them.</p>

    <h4>2. Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)</h4>
    <p>With 2FA, logging in requires something you know (your password) and something you have (like a code sent to your phone). This extra step makes it much harder for hackers to access your accounts.</p>

    <h4>3. Keep Software Updated</h4>
    <p>Software updates aren’t just for new features—they often include security patches. Make sure your operating system, apps, and antivirus software are up to date.</p>

    <h4>4. Be Cautious with Links and Attachments</h4>
    <p>Before clicking a link, hover over it to see where it leads. If an email or message feels off, don’t open attachments or click links. When in doubt, contact the sender directly to verify.</p>

    <h4>5. Secure Your Wi-Fi</h4>
    <p>At home, set a strong password for your Wi-Fi network and use encryption (WPA3 or WPA2). When you’re out, avoid public Wi-Fi unless you use a Virtual Private Network (VPN) to encrypt your connection.</p>

    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>Internet security is about recognizing risks and staying prepared. Common threats, like phishing attacks, malware, data breaches, and unsafe Wi-Fi networks, often exploit our everyday habits online. By staying informed and following best practices, you can confidently navigate the internet while keeping your personal information safe.</p>
