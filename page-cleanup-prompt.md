I want to apply the same optimization, styling, and best practices we implemented on `index.html` to my article pages.
**This Includes ALL these Steps**:

1.  **HTML Structure and Formatting:**
    * Ensure proper HTML structure with semantic elements (`<article>`, `<section>`, `<header>`, `<footer>`, etc.).
    * Correct any HTML formatting issues (indentation, tag usage, etc.).
    * Verify and optimize tags (title, description, keywords, robots, author, Open Graph, Twitter).
    * Add or verify favicons.
    * Add a link back to the index page.
    * Add a link to the full disclaimer page.
    * Add the short disclaimer to the footer of the page.
    * Add a `<noscript>` tag to the body of the html page.
    * Add a fallback inline style sheet to the head of the html document.

2.  **CSS Styling:**
    * Apply consistent styling from `style.css` to the article pages.
    * Ensure consistent typography (fonts, sizes, line heights).
    * Maintain a consistent color palette.
    * Style links and buttons to match the index page's style.
    * Add appropriate styles for headings, paragraphs, lists, and any other relevant elements.
    * Refine the mobile responsiveness using the same media queries as in `index.html`.
    * Add styles for the disclaimer section.
    * Add styles to the return to index button.

3.  **Content Optimization:**
    * Correct any spelling and grammar errors.
    * Improve the readability and flow of the content content.
    * DO NOT CHANGE the Content or the Main Structure unless **needed** and **approved**.
    * Ensure proper heading hierarchy (h1, h2, h3, etc.).
    * Format META content for clarity, attractiveness and functionality.
    * Add or improve image descriptions.

4.  **SEO and Accessibility:**
    * Optimize meta tags for search engines.
    * Ensure all images have descriptive `alt` attributes.
    * Use semantic HTML for accessibility.
    * Verify that the page is responsive on various devices.

5.  **Files Provided:**
    * I will provide the HTML file for the article (`article_name.html`).
    * I will provide the `style.css` file.

**Process:**

1.  I will provide the HTML and CSS files.
2.  You will review the files and identify areas for improvement.
3.  You will provide the updated HTML and CSS code with the requested changes.
4.  We will iterate on the changes until the article page is consistent with the index page and fully optimized.

This process will ensure that your article pages are optimized and consistent with your index page. Let's get started!
